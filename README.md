Invocation:
    ./oss [-t timeToExecute]

Project Description
    Create a project that simulates a scheduler that uses a multi-level process queue, and utilizes message queues to communicate between processes.

Arguments
    -h : Display a help message
    -t : Set the time for execution. If time expires before natural end of program, no logfile will be created.

Note: I was not able to implement a working block queue, and I feel the multilevel queue is acting fishy, but cannot confirm. Otherwise, code should work as intended and should not result in any seg faults or runtime errors.

Any code that is not my own was either approved by a professor, provided by a professor, or from Linux Man Pages.

Thanks!
